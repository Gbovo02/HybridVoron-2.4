# HybridVoron-2.4
Inspired by the hybrid Ratrig Vcore 4, I know no one asked for this, but I was intrigued by the work RatRig did and wanted to test it. <br />
The entire conversion doesn't take any space away from the build plate area, only on the Z axis.

# Mounting
The cover for the Z belts is to be removed and mounted with the version I modified, on the rear you need to use the STLs named "rear idler mount" and for the front "front motor-idler mount" <br />
On the X axis, you can re-use the same M5 bolt to secure the spacer needed for the belt holder

# BOM
* 12 M3 heat inserts (6 for each side) <br />
* 6 M5 bolts x 35 (3 for each side) <br />
* 4 M3 x 8 (2 for each side) <br />

# Current progress
The entire conversion is functional but, for now, it only works for the Chaoticlab carbon gantry kit. <br />
But I'm encountering the: MCU "mcu" error: Timer too close <br />
I'm working on a step-by-step guide using the CAD model and showing the printed parts

I know that my printer is not the best looking, please don't judge my printer, thanks in advance
