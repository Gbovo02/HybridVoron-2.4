# HybridVoron-2.4
Inspired by the hybrid Ratrig Vcore 4 and the Tridex, i wanted to fit a sistem that can be used to accomodate a second toolhead in the future or making the 2.4 similar to the base hybrid version of the V4

# Mounting
The cover for tyhe Z belts are to be removed and mount the version i modified, on the rear you need to use the STLs named "rear idler mount" and for the front "front motor-idler mount"
On the X axis you can re-use the same M5 bolt to secure the spacer needed for the belt tensioning part

# BOM
12 M3 heat inserts (6 for each side)
6 M5 bolt x 35 (3 for each side)
4 M3 x 8 (2 for each side)
